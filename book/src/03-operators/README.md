# Operators
 
This chapter delves into the various operators available in Rust, which are essential tools for performing operations on data and controlling program flow. Operators allow you to manipulate values, make comparisons, and execute logical operations that form the core of any programming logic.

We'll start with arithmetic operators for mathematical calculations, followed by assignment operators for modifying variable values. You'll then explore comparison operators for evaluating relationships between values, and logical operators for combining boolean expressions. The chapter also covers how these operators work specifically with different data types like strings (&str), tuples, and arrays.

Mastering these operators is fundamental to writing expressive and efficient Rust code. They serve as the building blocks for more complex operations and algorithms you'll develop as you progress.
