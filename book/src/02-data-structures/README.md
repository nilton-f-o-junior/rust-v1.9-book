# Data Types

This chapter explores the fundamental data types available in Rust, covering the essential building blocks you will use to store and manipulate information in your programs. Understanding these data types is crucial for writing efficient Rust code, as each type has specific characteristics, memory requirements, and use cases.

One of Rust's main strengths is its static typing system, meaning the compiler knows the exact type of each variable at compile time, providing benefits in both safety and performance. As in previous chapters, practical exercises are provided at the end to reinforce your understanding and ensure you are ready to proceed with confidence.
