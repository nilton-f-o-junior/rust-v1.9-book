# String and &str

This chapter covers Rust's string types – the fundamental tools for handling text data in your programs.

We'll start with string literals: &str for compile-time text, string slices for referencing parts of strings, and their immutable nature. Then we
'll explore owned strings: String for dynamic text creation, push and push_str for building strings, and methods for manipulation and transformation.

We'll also cover conversions – Rust's seamless transitions between &str and String, when to use each type, and how ownership affects your choice.

Each section includes practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these essential text-handling constructs.
