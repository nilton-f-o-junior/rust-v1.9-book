# Functions and Method Syntax

This chapter covers Rust's approach to functions, methods, and code organization – the core tools for building maintainable and reusable programs.

We'll start with the fundamentals: defining functions with fn, passing data through parameters, and returning values. Then we'll explore expressions – Rust's unique approach where almost everything produces a value, and how this differs from statements. Next, we'll dive into methods: implementing behavior on types with impl blocks, using self for instance methods, and creating associated functions. Finally, we'll cover modules: organizing code with mod, managing visibility with pub, and structuring projects for clarity and maintainability.

You'll find practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.
