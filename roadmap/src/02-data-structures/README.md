# Data Types

This chapter explores the fundamental data types available in Rust, covering the essential building blocks you'll use to store and manipulate information in your programs. Understanding these data types is crucial for writing effective Rust code, as each type has specific characteristics, memory requirements, and use cases.

We'll begin with numeric types, examining both unsigned (u) and signed (i) integers, followed by floating-point numbers for handling decimal values. You'll then learn about Boolean types for logical operations, character types for individual Unicode values, and the important distinction between String and &str for text handling.

The chapter concludes with compound data types—tuples for grouping related values of different types, and arrays for storing multiple elements of the same type. These structures form the foundation for more complex data organization patterns you'll encounter later.

One of Rust's key strengths is its statically typed system, which means the compiler knows the exact type of every variable at compile time. This provides both safety and performance benefits that you'll appreciate as you work through these examples.

By mastering these fundamental data types, you'll gain the knowledge needed to choose the right type for your specific programming needs. As with previous chapters, practice questions are provided at the end to reinforce your understanding and ensure you're ready to move forward confidently.
