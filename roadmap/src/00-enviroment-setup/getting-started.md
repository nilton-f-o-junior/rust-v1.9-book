# Getting Started

This project was conceived and developed so that you can study alongside me, writing code and creating practical projects. To make this possible, I need to teach you about the tools and resources that will allow you to put what you're learning into practice.

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/);
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install);
- [Editors and IDEs](editors-and-ides.md).
