# Rust Playground

The Rust Playground is the quickest way to start experimenting with Rust. It's an online environment where you can:

- Write and run Rust code directly in your browser;
- Test small examples and concepts;
- Share code with other developers;
- Experiment without needing to install anything.

Ideal for: first steps, quick tests, and experimentation.
