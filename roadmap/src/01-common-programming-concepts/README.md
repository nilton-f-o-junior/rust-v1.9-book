# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter was developed to introduce the fundamental concepts of the Rust programming language. However, the topics covered here are also present in other programming languages. If this is the first time you are encountering these concepts, I hope you can understand each point clearly, as this forms the essential basis for what will come in the following chapters.

At the end, you will find some practical exercises, allowing you to check if you missed any concepts during your studies. But don't worry, the questions are very simple and include the answers.
