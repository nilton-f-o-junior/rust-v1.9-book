# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter was developed to introduce the fundamental concepts of the Rust programming language. However, the topics covered here are also present in other programming languages, so if you understand how they work, it will be quite similar to what you're already familiar with. If this is your first time encountering these concepts, I hope you'll be able to understand each point clearly, as this forms the essential foundation for what's to come in the following chapters.

At the end, you'll have some questions to answer as practice, allowing you to verify that you haven't missed any concepts while studying. Don't worry though—the questions are quite straightforward and include the answers.
