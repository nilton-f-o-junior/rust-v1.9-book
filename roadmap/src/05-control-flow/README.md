# Control Flow

This chapter covers Rust's control flow structures – the fundamental tools for making decisions and repeating actions in your programs.

We'll start with conditional statements: if for basic decisions, else for alternatives, and combined if-else for multiple scenarios. Then we'll explore loops: loop for infinite iterations, while for condition-based repetition, and for for iterating over collections.

We'll also cover match – Rust's powerful pattern matching feature that handles complex conditions with precision and safety.

Each section includes practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these essential programming constructs.
