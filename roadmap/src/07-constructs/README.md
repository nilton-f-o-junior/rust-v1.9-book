# Constructs

This chapter covers Rust's core type constructs – the fundamental building blocks for creating custom types and defining their behavior.

We'll start with data structures: struct for grouping related data into coherent types, and enum for representing values that can be one of several variants. Then we'll explore behavior: impl blocks for adding methods to your types, and trait for defining shared behavior that multiple types can implement.

You'll find practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.
