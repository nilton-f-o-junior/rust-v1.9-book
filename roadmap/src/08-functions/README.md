# Functions

This chapter covers Rust's approach to functions and code organization – the essential tools for structuring reusable and maintainable programs.

We'll start with the fundamentals: defining functions and passing data through parameters. Then we'll explore expressions – Rust's distinctive approach where nearly everything produces a value. Finally, we'll cover modules: organizing code inline with nested mod blocks, splitting code into separate files with external modules, and structuring larger projects with mod.rs for clear hierarchies.

You'll find practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.
