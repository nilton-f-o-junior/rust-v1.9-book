# Vector

This chapter covers Rust's Vec`<T>` type – the fundamental dynamic collection for storing and manipulating sequences of values.

We'll start with the basics: creating vectors and accessing elements through indexing. Then we'll explore adding elements: push for appending to the end and insert for placing values at specific positions. Finally, we'll cover removing elements: pop for taking the last item and remove for deleting elements by index.

You'll find practice questions to reinforce your understanding of these fundamental programming concepts.
